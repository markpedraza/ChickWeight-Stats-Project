# We will now train linear regression models. But first, we must take out identifier coloumn "Chick"
# Condition to remove unique identifier "Chick". We need to do this before making a linear regression model.
cond = c(-3) # removes 3rd column, which is "Chick"
cwt = ChickWeight[,cond] # Copy the data without this new column to a variable.

# The diet column should be factorized, we check if it is. If not, we factorize it ourselves.
# Here we see diet is already factorized. So now we're good to create our model.

# Make 2 linear regression models to predict weight based off time and diet
# - mod.1 has an interaction variable between Time and Diets.
# - mod.2 does not have an interaction variable.
mod.1 = lm(weight ~ Time * Diet,data=cwt)
mod.2 = lm(weight ~ .,data=cwt)

# Present summary of Model 1 -  W/ INTERACTION
# - All predictors significant besides Diet2/3/4. Likely because we implemented it into interaction
# - F test shows model is significant
# - R2 = 0.773 R2A = 0.7702 - Model has good R2 values
summary(mod.1)

# Present Summary of Model 2 - NO INTERACTION
# - All predictors are significant
# - F test shows model is significant
# - R2 = 0.7453 R2A = 0.7435 - Model has good R2 values
summary(mod.2)

# Overall, Model 1 with the interaction terms seems slightly more reliable.
# This could mean that there is a relationship between Time and all the diets. 
# It could be that diets tend to get better over time, instead of having a linear relationship.

## PART 2 - T-TEST AND CONFIDENCE INTERAVALS ---#-------------------------------

## Confidence intervals
## - These will give a 95% confidence interval for the mean weight at the specified diet and day. (Day is always 21 here)

# DIET 1 - Day 21
# - We are 95% confident that the mean weight of chicks on Diet 1, Day 21 is between 146.4699 and 209.0301.
subset_data <- subset(ChickWeight, Time == 21 & Diet == 1)
t.test(subset_data$weight, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int

# DIET 2 - Day 21
# - We are 95% confident that the mean weight of chicks on Diet 2, Day 21 is between 158.8034 and 270.5966.
subset_data <- subset(ChickWeight, Time == 21 & Diet == 2)
t.test(subset_data$weight, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int

# DIET 3 - Day 21
# - We are 95% confident that the mean weight of chicks on Diet 3, Day 21 is between 219.0643 and 321.5357.
subset_data <- subset(ChickWeight, Time == 21 & Diet == 3)
t.test(subset_data$weight, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int

# DIET 4 - Day 21
# - We are 95% confident that the mean weight of chicks on Diet 4, Day 21 is between 205.2355 and 271.8756.
subset_data <- subset(ChickWeight, Time == 21 & Diet == 4)
t.test(subset_data$weight, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int

# From these confidence intervals, Diet 3 seems to have the largest interval at 219.0643 and 321.5357 compared to the rest.


# This shows the confidence interval for each variable in the mod.1 Linear Regression Model
# Remember that this model includes interaction terms
confint(mod.1, level = 0.98)


## T-Tests
## - Compare the mean weight of chicks under two different diets (1-2, 3-4, and 1-4) at a specific time (day 21).

# No significant difference between the means
subset_data <- subset(ChickWeight, Time == 21 & Diet %in% c(1, 2))
t.test(weight ~ Diet, data = subset_data)

# No significant difference between the means
subset_data <- subset(ChickWeight, Time == 21 & Diet %in% c(3, 4))
t.test(weight ~ Diet, data = subset_data)

# Significant different between the means
subset_data <- subset(ChickWeight, Time == 21 & Diet %in% c(1, 4))
t.test(weight ~ Diet, data = subset_data)


# Despite Diet 3 having the highest confidence interval when tested earlier,
# there is no significant difference between the means of Diet 3 and Diet 4.
# Could this mean that both diets have chicks that obtain the same weight on average
# after 21 days on the diet?

# From the graph, we see that the slopes created for all 3 diets are different.
# From steepest slope to most gradual, we have...
# Steepest -
# 1. Diet 3
# 2. Diet 4
# 3. Diet 2
# 4. Diet 1
# Gradual -
# So over time, more weight is added to chicks on Diet 3 than any other diet.

# Similar visual as to one before but it seperates the linear regressions lines
# and separates them by the diet. For the most part, there is no outliers in the data.
# However, for Diet 2, there are quite a few points below the fitted line towards the later half.

# Residual Plot - (Model Diagnostics)
# - Unfortunately, this model violates the equal variance test. But it does pass the others.

# This color codes each individual chick to their specific diet. Admittedly, this graph
# is hard to interpret since theres many lines. However, we can generally see Diet 3 tends to lead
# towards the later half, just as the previous graph showed. However, we can see that there a couple
# chicks that fall in extreme sides. For example, there is a chick on Diet 2 that gains a massive amount
# of weight as time went on, yet there is another chick with the same diet that completely stagnates in weight
# after day 6 or so. These extremes could affect predictions and statistics.

# Boxplots of Weight by Diet at a Specific Day

# These plots show similar inferences we've had before. The median follows the mean
# in terms of rankings by weight on Day 21. Again, from largest median to smallest we see
# Diet 3, 4, 2, then 1. 
# We also see in teh plot that Diet 2 have a very long bottom whisker, which shows 
# 25% of the data for diet 2 has wide variation and the lowest minimum of the 4 diets
# without necessarily having any outliers.
# On the other hand, Diet 4 has a very small bottom whisker. This could mean that although
# the average and median weights of the chicks are lower than that of Diet 3, they also do
# not reach anywhere close to the minimums of Diet 3. This could be seen as a positive for Diet 4.

# This data shows the 95% confidence interval of mean weight over time by diet. Its a little difficult to see initially, as
