# ChickWeight-Stats-Project
Group statistical data analysis project for my STA 3000 (Statistical Computing) class, lectured by Professor Soo In Yun. This project was completed in conjunction with my fellow groupmates, Kobe Philbert-Willis, Fernando Rey, and Carlo Capan. Two items are included in this repo.

## R File
This is the code written by me to create all the statistics and visuals used for our project. All code was written in the R programming language for its robust statistical analysis tools. There are also plently of commnets in the file that detail all the steps taken to get our statistics as well as which sections of code do what. 

## Group Report
For our project, we chose the "ChickWeights" dataset inside R. The dataset contains groups of chicks seperated by diet. It then reported their weights each day over the course of a 3 weeks. From this dataset, our goal was to see which diet most significantly increased chick weight. Further details are all inside the project report.
